Survol is a software intelligence tool, made to display everything that runs on a computer.

It is a web interface which lets you navigate on all IT resources on a machine: Applications, databases, files, network connections, libraries, users, remote servers etcâ€¦ they all become visible with the same ease-of-use. No technical knowledge is necessary. No command line, just clicking on icons.

It is very useful with undocumented systems, spanning many different skills, and perhaps legacy applications. These applications can be so big and complicated, that it is very difficult to have an overview. With Survol, anyone can quickly see what an IT system is doing.

Because it is a very light agent, in pure Python, it can safely run on any machine; So, everyone can follow a project life-cycle from development to production. Everyone can see which software version, which major components are installed and running on a configuration.

The data model is based on `semantic web
<https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/>`_ concepts, and industry standards such as `CIM
<https://www.dmtf.org/standards/cim>`_ and `WBEM
<https://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem>`_. Therefore, Survol can easily exchange data with other tools.

It is very modular: You can add your own scripts, to display information specific to your project, mixed with data provided by default.

Survol collects data from a running system, on-demand. It does not slow down a machine by accumulating statistics on a running system, because the quantity of data is so huge that it is useless.
Instead, Survol assists an investigation, by letting a user choose the data that are needed.

Survol has several views on the same data: HTML, SVG, D3 JavaScript library and RDF.
