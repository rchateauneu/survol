Survol is a tool made to show everything that runs on a computer.

It is a web interface which lets you navigate on all IT resources on a machine: Applications, databases, files, etcâ€¦ they all become visible with the same ease-of-use. No technical knowledge is necessary. No command line, just clicking on icons.

It is mostly useful with undocumented systems, spanning many different skills, and perhaps legacy applications. Anyone can quickly see what an IT system is doing. It also shows other machines on a network.

Because it is a very light agent, in pure Python, it can safely run on any machine; So, everyone can follow a project life-cycle from development to production. Everyone can see which software version, which major components are installed and running on a configuration.

It is based on semantic web concepts, therefore the data model is clear. It is implemented with industry standards such as CIM and WBEM, so it can exchange data with many tools.

It is very modular: You can add your own scripts, to display information specific to your project, mixed with core data.
