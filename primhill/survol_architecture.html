&nbsp;</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>ARCHITECTURE<br><br></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol needs to
run one agent
per machine: A plain HTTP server running <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">Common Gateway Interface</a> (CGI) Python scripts. This agent and
its port number define the identity of each object of this machine,
that Survol is able to provide information about. This is the
same concept as in WMI and WBEM, and both interoperate completely.
Therefore, Survol is able to get information with another machine
with no Survol agent: See OpenLMI, WMI etc... <br><br>If your browser runs ActiveX, it is also possible to use Survol web pages with no agent.<br><br>Survol
is based on a tree of Python scripts, all of them display information
of the system the agent is running on. Some scripts do not need
parameters: They will return information with no context: For example,
all available databases, all detected machines on the network, all
installed Python modules etc... Other scripts need parameters, as they
display information about a specific object. For example; Files opened
by a specific process. Columns of a SQL Server</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">&#8482;</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> table. Processes connected to an Oracle&#8482; database.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br>As a benefit of a CGI-based architecture, <span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">it
is also possible to run any Python scripts as command-line programs.
This allows to test them in isolation with full control on ther
environment and input, and full visibility on the output. This greatly helps when creating and testing scripts.<br><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">DISPLAY
MODES AND INTERNAL DATA REPRESENTATION</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<img style="float: right; width: 140px; height: 153px; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" alt="Resource Description Framework" title="Resource Description Framework" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Rdf_logo.svg/221px-Rdf_logo.svg.png"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">The
internal data model built by Survol, is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>,
a standard model for data interchange in the Web. The data
representation of Survol is a RDF graph: a set
of triples: Subject, relation, object, and is also the core data type
found in the </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic
web</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">.
It is successfully used in Artificial Intelligence applications. This
abstract representation is independent of the display mode. The same set
of
data, extracted from an information system, is shown several ways:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>Interactive mode, fully interactive, designed for
investigating, browsing, drilling into applications internals. It uses <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, a nice JavaScript
library for manipulating graphs.</li>
<li>The print
mode: the rendered view cannot be modified but is designed to be
printed for reports or presentations. The appearance is very
close to the interactive one, but the layout is always identical, and
the users cannot change it. It
uses <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>,
an&nbsp;open source graph visualization software. Graphviz is not
an absolute requirement.</li>
<li>The plain HTML mode, convenient to generate reports in
plain text, reports which can be saved, and compared.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">There are also two
output modes, used internally:<br>
</span>
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>A JSON mode of use JavaScript-based display. At the moment,
the client-side graphic library is D3, with projects to use also
<a href="http://www.cytoscape.org/">Cytoscape</a>,
another software platform for visualizing complex network. Survol is
extremely modular, and adding a new front-end is a totally independent
task.</li>
<li>A native RDF mode which can be used as an input to such as <strong class="upcase bold-a" style="font-size: 16px;"><a style="font-weight: normal;" href="https://protege.stanford.edu/">Protégé</a><span style="font-weight: normal;">.</span></strong>
<strong class="upcase bold-a" style="font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal;">Protégé
is&nbsp;</strong>an ontology editor and framework, for
building intelligent systems and knowledge-based solutions.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">WMI, WBEM, CIM</span></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">To
start with, some acronyms. WBEM&#8482; stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management">Web-Based
Enterprise Management</a>,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" class="st">an
industry initiative to develop a standard technology for accessing
management information in an enterprise environment.</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> This standard is governed
by DMTF, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Management_Task_Force">Distributed
Management Task Force</a>. WMI&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" class="st">is the
Microsoft implementation of WBEM</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">. In the Linux world, a
common implementation of WBEM is <a href="http://www.openlmi.org/">OpenLMI</a>.
It is based on an open-source implementation named <a href="https://collaboration.opengroup.org/pegasus/">OpenPegasus</a>&#8482;.
WBEM standard information is delivered with CIM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28computing%29">Common
Information
Model</a>).&nbsp; The CIM schema is the model for delivering
this standard
information.&nbsp; </span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
To
summarize, WBEM define classes of computer-related objects: Processes,
files, network cards etc... have a valid and detailed definition in CIM.
Here are some examples:<br>
<br>
</span>
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>CIM_Process</td>
<td>This is the
base class of a process, which is derived into Win32_Process</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>A normal file:
The concept and its implementation are similar in Windows and Linux. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>CIM_Directory</td>
<td>File
directories</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Win32_UserAccount</td>
<td>A Windows user
account. Linux has a specific definition, unrelated to this one.</td>

<br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SURVOL DATA MODEL</span></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
One
of the core aspects of Survol is its data model which attempts to take
the best of the worlds it is working in. A first approach is WBEM.
However, the data description offered by WBEM suffers from several
drawbacks:<br>
</span>
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>It
does not define all the objects we need, because CIM is very neutral, not
oriented to applicaiotns management. For example, database tables, or sockets, or Python packages
or Samba&#8482; servers have no definition. It
is indeed possible to add new classes into WIM or WMI, but not in a
portable way, and it requires C++ code compilation etc... this is quite
a heavy process.</li>
<li>Also:
WQL, the CIM query language, has some limitations: It does not allow
joins between several classes, and a query can return objects of a
single class only. Whereas some information snapshot would require of
all sorts of objects to completely describe a situation: Some examples
which cannot be described by WQL queries could be: All network files
accessed by a process, plus their sockets. Or linkable symbols from a
DLL file. Or SQL queries detected in a process
memory, plus their tables. These are quite common situations when
investigating an application. However, it can be represented with WBEM.</li>
<li>On
top of that, WMI and WBEM suffer from several specific performance
problems which are difficult to overcome. These problems come from the
indistinct processing of objects, whatever their behaviour. For
example, selecting all CMI_Datafile objects will return all files on a
given machine: This is obviously very difficult to handle.<br>
</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Despite
this, building a software on an industrial standard is invaluably
convenient. Therefore, Survol attempts to combine the best of both
worlds:<br>
</span>
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>Existing
WBEM classes are always reused. When the classes are different in Linux
and Windows, but a common base class exist, this base&nbsp;class
is
chosen. Survol uses only a subset of WBEM ontologies: That is, it uses
only the minimal number of WBEM class properties which are necessary to
uniquely define an object. However, all detected properties are
displayed, when available.</li>
<li>Survol comes with a lightweight
ontology and data definition where a class is only defined by a
directory in a Python source code tree.</li>
<li>When an object is
defined by Survol, its equivalent link into WBEM or WMI is calculated
and accessible. WBEM, WMI and Survol use the same moniker strings
(Object path).</li>
<li>It
is possible to display any WMI or WBEM object and navigate into their
repository. Survol is -also- a complete read-only WBEM objects browser.
Notably, Survol can "talk" with WBEM or WMI running on distant machines.</li>
</ul>

SURVOL CLASSES AND NAMESPACES. ADDING NEW CLASSES</span></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol library is
made of packages and subpackages which represents its
classes model.
A class is a module where the function Ontology() is present, whether
it is defined
by the module or one of its parents modules.
The return value of EntityOntology() is a list of string, each
representing an attribute of the class.
If a module nor none of its parent modules define the function
EntityOntology(),
it is a namespace.
</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">A class or
namespace can define other functions in its __init__.py
file. All of them are optional:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<table style="text-align: left; width: 100%; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">Function</span><br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">What it does</span><br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">EntityOntology<br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">This
returns an array of strings which are the name of the attributes of an
object of this class. This does not apply to namespaces.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Graphic_colorbg<br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">This
returns a RBG colour coded as a hexadecimal string. This colour is used
by any UI mode, for this class/namespace, unless it is superseded by a
subclass or subnamespace.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">EntityName<span style="color: rgb(128, 128, 128);"></span></td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">This returns a
display name for
this object, given its attributes passed as an array, in the order
specified by the ontology. The hostname is also passed as an argument. The resulting
name does have to be unique, but must be printable. This applies to
classes only.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">AddInfo</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">When displaying an
object, adds some extra information related to it.<br>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Usable<br>
</td>
<td style="vertical-align: top;">This tells if the
module or the
script, is usable in this context, given the platform, available
packages etc... It can be defined for any module or any script.<br>
</td>
</tr>

</table>
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol aims to
address the diversity of applications running for dozens
of years on a variety of architectures.
Its framework, based on a tree of Python modules and scripts makes it
very easy to add processing
to include libraries, architectures, etc.. The concept is the same as adding providers in WBEM and WMI.
The inclusion of different architectures in Survol framework, adding a
new class, or new scripts, to Survol, is a trivial task: One just need
to copy a file tree at a specific place. It is of course possible to
mix open-source and proprietary scripts.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">SCRIPTS REDUNDANCY</span></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol is designed
to run in a harsh environment, uncertain platforms,
broken libraries, incompatible interfaces,
and return as much information as possible about unknown applications.
It has to be robust and adapt to any situation.
Therefore, it is built, at all stages, on the concept of redundancy.
</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Redundancy
of data
display:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol can display
its results in:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>Plain HTML text: Results of the same scripts are guaranteed
to be return in the same order,
allowing automatic comparison. It can be displayed on a very simple
browser.</li>
<li>Static SVG generated by Graphviz, on the server side. It
does not need a powerful client machine.</li>
<li>Client-side D3 display: It is not demanding on the server
side, but needs a more powerful client.</li>
<li>RDF output, for Semantic Web engine.</li>
<li>JSON output: This is used by D3, its API is stable and can
be used by client software too.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Redundancy
of
information sources:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">The core
information might come from any source: win32 Python library,
any Linux package, WMI and WBEM select statements.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Redundancy
of Web
hosting:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Scripts can be
hosted by Apache, IIS&#8482;, the dedicated ad hoc CGI server.
Any reasonable HTTP server
with CGI or WSGI capabilities should suffice.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Redundancy
of Python
interpreter and libraries:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>It can use Python2 and Python3, over many releases. Survol
is not very demanding in terms of Python features.</li>
<li>Packages: Python requires a very small set of modules. If a script needs an optional Python module
which is not installed, the script is simply disabled, doing no harm.</li>
<li>Scripts
might return information with a significant overlap, from different
libraries or mechanisms.
This is helpful if one script does not work, as a work-around might
exist.
And, because objects, in Survol, always have the same URL, this does
not yield duplicate,
when combining, merging the results of several scripts into
one:
Duplicate information is automatically removed when at this stage.
Even objects created by ActiveX&#8482; are smoothly paired with the ones
created by Python agents. This is the reason why objects URLs do not
accept any CGI parameter except the display mode. </li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span></span><span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">CREDENTIALS FILES<br><br></span></span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol
scripts access many software resources, some of them being protected
with credentials, typically a username and a password. These
credentials are made available to Survol with a JSON file,
SurvolCredentials.json, residing in the users' home directory.
Depending on the user running the HTTP server (Apache, IIS etc...),
this home directory may vary. This file can be edited with the "<span style="font-style: italic;">Credentials</span>" page link.<br><br>It
contains several types of credentials, depending on the type of access:
Database software, middleware library etc... For each of this access
type, it is possible to add, delete, update any credentials. On the
other hand, it is not possible, without extra development, to add new
types of credentials as these need specific software to use them.<br><br>A typical content of this file might be:<br><br><br></span><table style="width: 748px; height: 648px;" border="1">
