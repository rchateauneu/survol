<br>
Survol</span><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
is Primhill Computer's Software Intelligence tool to analyse and investigate information systems.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br>With time, software development and maintenance increase in complexity. 
Existing systems and new technologies compete with each other at fast 
rate, creating an instable multi-dimensional environment, which 
challenges systems' continuity and evolution.<br>
<br>
For development teams, understanding the existing IT environment is a 
critical need. Among analysis techniques, the most reliable is the 
automatic collection of information on running systems, based on 
industrial standards.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Survol</span> creates intelligence in complex architecture by identifying the 
conceptual and engineering objects hidden in critical applications, 
across different languages and frameworks, when they run. It provides IT leaders and 
engineers with semantic analysis and insight in existing or legacy 
information systems.<br><br><b style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol</b><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> is a Python agent and a
web interface aiming to help understand an existing information system,
perhaps legacy applications.
A set of machines, processes, databases, programs etc .... all
communicating with each other,
manipulating your data, and whose software architecture has become,
with time, complicated,&nbsp;difficult to understand, and
undocumented.</span><br><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans; font-weight: bold;">WHO
IS IT MADE FOR?</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol is designed
for two classes of users:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>Managers
in charge of software projects, who must to follow development tasks,
infrastructure evolutions,&nbsp;by looking directly into what's
being
developed. They need a non-technical tool, to extract information from
a running application at a synthetic level.</li>
<li>Consultants,
newly-comers on legacy software, who must be grasp quickly an existing
information system, using many, too many technologies.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">These
users have something in common: They must quickly grasp a large
software architecture, maybe constantly changing:
With its visual interfaces, Survol is also a team-building tool,
bringing clarity, helping to give the same names to the same things.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans; font-weight: bold;">WHAT
DOES IT DO?</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<img title="Processes tree" style="width: 528px; height: 307px; float: right; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" alt="" src="Survol/SnapshotProcesses.PNG"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol allows to display
any software entity or resources running on a
computer. Simply said, it is a library of Python scripts, each of them
displaying a facet of an information system.
</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">These scripts are
run by Survol agents, these agents running on one or several machines
of the user application network.
The web interface then displays and aggregates&nbsp; the
heterogeneous information
coming from the agents.
It is not necessary to have an agent on all machines because many
scripts can get information from different machines than their own.
Strictly said, it is possible to run without
an&nbsp;agent at all, just with a static JavaScript page which
connects to the target machines.</span> <span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">The agents are very
lightweight and can also run on an </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things"><span style="font-style: italic;">Internet of Things</span></a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> (IoT) network.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">The
data model of Survol is based on classes, each of them defining a type
of computer resources: Processes, machines, files
etc...&nbsp;Heterogeneous data are modelled into a single
dramework,
then aggregated with an RDF inference engine, creating a global vision
of the business information processing. It can display for example the
tree of processes and subprocesses ...</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<img title="Directories and subdirectories" style="width: 372px; height: 234px; float: left; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" alt="" src="Survol/SnapshotFiles.PNG"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">...
or a directory and its subdirectories: Each file is displayed with some
basic properties. One can click on each box to get further information,
as no keyboard is needed. No special technical skills are needed to use
Survol. The general details one can grasp about the various interaction
between components of an information system, greatly help its
understanding: Links between machines, processes, databases and any
other components are visible. Useful dependencies are extracted without
documentation.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol
fully respects the security policy of the network it is running on: If
the agent runs on a privileged account, it will extract many
information. But even with a dummy account, it will still be able to
retrieve useful data about the analysed system. Survol does not ever
modify or change anything on the machines it is running on, so it is
very safe.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<img title="Shared memory segments" style="width: 593px; height: 292px; float: left; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" alt="" src="Survol/SnapshotMemmaps.PNG"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Here,
this displays the shared memory segments and the processes mapping
them. Everything can be combined in graphic reports, everyone can
understand. The data model borrows extensively its ontology and
terminology from </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28computing%29">Common
Information Model</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">,&nbsp;an
existing industrial standard. Therefore, it interacts freely with CIM
implementations such as </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa394582%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">Microsoft
WMI</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">,
</span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="http://www.openlmi.org/">OpenLMI</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">, </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="http://www.opengroup.org/subjectareas/management/openpegasus">OpenPegasus</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;"> and
</span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://www.dmtf.org/standards/wbem">WBEM</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">, and any other software
based on this standard.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">It
is very easy to add new scripts, to display a specific kind of
information, only your application defines. When resources types are
not defined by CIM, Survol adds its own resource classes, in a very
simply way.
If a user application defines its resources classes, it is very easy to
add ones, along with associated scripts, in open or proprietary source
code, without complicated setup. Just create a directory and add a new
script at the right place, that's it.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<img style="width: 281px; height: 178px; float: right; font-family: DejaVu Sans;" alt="" title="Python modules" src="Survol/SnapshotPythonModules.PNG"><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">The
internal data model built by Survol agents, is a set
of triples: Subject, relation, object, homogeneous to <span style="font-style: italic;">Resource Description Framework</span>
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">RDF</a>),
the core data type found in the </span><a style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web">Semantic
web</a><span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">, a
standard </span>which provides a framework allowing data to be
shared and reused across applications<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">.
RDF, especially appropriate for Artificial Intelligence applications,
is an abstract model for Survol data, which are extracted from
heterogenous sources information system. Survol displays these data in
several modes:</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li>Interactive mode, fully interactive, designed for
investigating, browsing, drilling into applications internals. It uses <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a>, a nice JavaScript
library for manipulating graphs.</li>
<li>A
print
mode, where the rendered view cannot be modified but is designed to be
nicely printed for reporting or presentations. The appearance is
similar to the interactive one, but the layout does not depend on User
interaction. It
uses <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">Graphviz</a>,
an&nbsp;open source graph visualization software.</li>
<li>The plain HTML mode, convenient to generate reports in
plain text, reports which can be saved, and compared.</li>
</ul>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol,
is an
open-source project: Everyone can&nbsp;freely download and use it.
Survol can have add-ons: It is very easy to customize Survol by adding
new
scripts and classes: One just need to add Python scripts at the right
place: Their returned information can&nbsp;now fully integrate with
the
rest of Survol model. Survol fully uses Python documentation features
to expose your add-on and its integrated documentation.</span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">CAN I TRY?</span></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans; font-weight: bold;"></span><br style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol is
installed on these&nbsp;machines, in different configurations:</span>
<ul style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">
<li><a href="ui/index.htm">Javascript interface</a>
: This is the main entry point, on this server, with many security restrictions.</li>
<li><a href="http://primhillcomputers.com/cgi-bin/survol/survolcgi.py?script=/sources_types/Linux/etc_passwd.py&amp;xid=.&amp;mode=html">Entry
point, in text mode</a> <span style="text-decoration: underline;">:</span> Same data, in text mode.</li><li><span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span><a href="http://primhillcomputers.ddns.net/Survol/survol/www/index.htm">Survol
on Fedora Linux</a> :This is a Fedora 22 machine, with a complete
installation (Sometimes stopped).</li><li><a href="http://54.36.162.150:8000/survol/www/index.htm">Survol, Fedora 26</a>: Always available</li>

<span style="font-style: italic; font-family: DejaVu Sans;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?</span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family: DejaVu Sans;">Survol
is free and open-source, and will stay so. But users might invest into
its
installation, consulting, training. Or possibly into proprietary
development of
specific scripts, adapted to their own needs.<br>
