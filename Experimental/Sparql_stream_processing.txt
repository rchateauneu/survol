The goal is to run spqral queries on a huge amount of data, coming from a stream.
* A lot of data.
* Endless data.
* Impossible to decide when all data is available.

The solution is to split Sparql queries into independent, smller queries, which are run on a stream
of incoming data. This is not possible in the general case, only for some types of queries.
* These Sparql queries input and output RDF triples: They can be piped.
* Merge several pipes into one.
* Sparql queries output less data than they input.
* They store locall the data they might need further, in local RDF triples data stores.

See C-SPARQL, and RSP (RDF stream processing).

Possibly implement a new mode for existing scripts, with which they would push events to a C-Sparql engine.
