"""
The intention is to port a subset of pydbg:
- It must be in pure Python.
- Python 2 and 3.
- Needed features: attach to a process, log calls to some system api funcitons,
with the arguments.

It would have been possible to fork pydbg but:
- This project is not maintained, not is OpenRCE http://www.openrce.org/ of which it is part.
- Not all features are needed
- Features which are unneeded are quite dangerous and it might be impossible to install
the package because of this reason.

Hence the choice of porting a ubset of pydbg
