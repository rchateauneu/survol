The CollectionOfMSEs object does not carry any state or status information, but only represents a grouping or 'bag' of Elements. For this reason, it is incorrect to subclass groups that have state/status from CollectionOfMSEs - an example is CIM_RedundancyGroup (which is correctly subclassed from LogicalElement).
Collections typically aggregate 'like' objects, and represent an optimization. Without Collections, one is forced to define individual ElementSetting and ElementConfiguration associations, to tie Settings and Configuration objects to individual ManagedSystemElements. There may be much duplication in assigning the same Setting to multiple objects. In addition, using the Collection object allows the determination that the Setting and Configuration associations are indeed the same for the Collection's members. This information would otherwise be obtained by defining the Collection in a proprietary manner, and then querying the ElementSetting and ElementConfiguration associations to determine if the Collection set is completely covered.""" .

For example, to connect to a mail system from 'home', a dependency on a modem exists, but a dependency on a network adapter exists at 'work'. Settings for the pertinent logical devices (in this example, POTS modem and network adapter) can be defined and aggregated by CIM_Configuration.

The latter detailed is captured using a CIM_SoftwareElement  class.   When a software feature can exist on multiple platforms or  operating systems (for example, a client component of a  three tiered client/server applications might run on Solaris,  Windows NT, and Windows 95), a software feature is a collection  of all the software elements for these different platforms.  In this case, the users of the model must be aware of this situation  since typically they will be interested in a sub-collection of the  software elements required for a particular platform.   Software features are always defined in the context of a  CIM_Product class using the CIM_ProductSoftwareFeatures  association since features are delivered through products.

The processor is the part of the computer that performs arithmetic and logical computations, initiates operations on peripherals, and runs the threads of processes. A computer can have multiple processors. On some computers, processors are organized in NUMA nodes that share hardware resources such as physical memory. The Processor Information counter set represents each processor as a pair of numbers, where the first number is the NUMA node number and the second number is the zero-based index of the processor within that NUMA node. If the computer does not use NUMA nodes, the first number is zero." ;

Note that this is different from the tasks scheduled using the Windows 2000 Task Scheduler. This class is only instrumented on Windows NT 4.0 and later.  Each job scheduled against the schedule service is stored persistently (the scheduler will know to start the job even after a reboot) and is executed at the specified time and day of the week and/or month.  If the computer is not active or if the scheduled service is not running at the specified job time the schedule service will run the specified job on the next day at the specified time.  Scheduled jobs are scheduled with respect to Universal Coordinated Time (UTC), i.e. with bias offset from GMT.  This means that a job can be specified using any time zone specification.  The Win32_ScheduledJob class will return the local time with UTC offset when enumerating an object and convert to local time when creating new jobs.  For example a job specified to run on a computer in Boston at 10:30 pm Monday PST time will be scheduled to run locally at 1:30am Tuesday EST.  It should be noted that a client must take into account whether daylight savings time is in operation on the local computer and if so subtract a bias of 60 minutes from the UTC offset." ;

A color plane is another way to represent pixel colors; instead of assigning a single RGB value to each a pixel, color planes separate the graphic into each of the primary color components (red green blue), and store them in their own planes.  This allows for greater color depths on 8 and 16 bit video systems.   Present graphics systems have the bitwidth large enough to store color depth information, making only one color plane necessary.

When a new valid sample is available, the computed time is updated with the time offset indicated by the sample. This is the actual time offset of the local clock. W32time initiates clock correction using this offset and updates the computed time in between samples with the remaining time offset that needs to be applied to the local clock. Clock accuracy can be tracked using this performance counter with a low polling interval (eg:256 seconds or less) and looking for the counter value to be smaller than the desired clock accuracy limit." ;

Create_Default_Error_Mode - Newly created processes are given the system default error mode of the calling process instead of inheriting the error mode of the parent process.  This flag is useful for multi-threaded shell applications that run with hard errors disabled.
Create_New_Console - The new process has a new console, instead of inheriting the parent's console. This flag cannot be used with the Detached_Process flag.
Create_New_Process_Group - The new process is the root process of a new process group. The process group includes all processes that are descendants of this root process. The process identifier of the new process group is the same as the process identifier (returned in the ProcessID property of the Win32_Process class).  Process groups are used by the GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent function to enable sending a CTRL+C or CTRL+BREAK signal to a group of console processes.
Create_Suspended - The primary thread of the new process is created in a suspended state and does not run until the ResumeThread function is called.
Create_Unicode_Environment - The environment settings listed in the EnvironmentVariables property use Unicode characters. If clear, the environment block uses ANSI characters.
Debug_Process - If this flag is set, the calling process is treated as a debugger, and the new process is a process being debugged.  The system notifies the debugger of all debug events that occur in the process being debugged.  On Windows 95 and Windows 98 systems, this flag is not valid if the new process is a 16-bit application.
Debug_Only_This_Process - If not set and the calling process is being debugged, the new process becomes another process being debugged by the process of the calling debugger. If the calling process is not a process being debugged, no debugging related actions occur.
Detached_Process - For console processes, the new process does not have access to the console of the parent process.  This flag cannot be used if the Create_New_Console flag is set.""" ;

It also includes requests in service at the time of the collection. This is a instantaneous snapshot, not an average over the time interval. Multi-spindle disk devices can have multiple requests that are active at one time, but other concurrent requests are awaiting service. This counter might reflect a transitory high or low queue length, but if there is a sustained load on the disk drive, it is likely that this will be consistently high. Requests experience delays proportional to the length of this queue minus the number of spindles on the disks. For good performance, this difference should average less than two." ;

OptOut indicates DEP is on by default for all 32-bit applications and that a user or administrator must explicitly remove support for a 32-bit application by adding to an exceptions list. OptIn indicates DEP is on for a limited number of binaries, the kernel, and all Windows services but it is off by default for all 32-bit applications; a user or administrator must explicitly choose the AlwaysOn (not available in the user interface) or OptOut setting before DEP can be applied to 32-bit applications.

    rdfs:label "ErrorMode" ;
    rdfs:comment """The ErrorMode property controls how the operating system handles several types of serious errors.  You can specify that the operating system handle these errors or that the application receives and handles them.  On some non-x86 processors, misaligned memory references cause an alignment fault exception.  The No_Alignment_Fault_Except flag lets you control whether the system automatically fixes such alignment faults or makes them visible to an application.  On a MIPS platform, an application must explicitly call SetErrorMode with the No_Alignment_Fault_Except flag to have the operating system automatically fix alignment faults.  The default setting is for the operating system to make alignment faults visible to an application.  Since the x86 platform does not make alignment faults visible to an application, the No_Alignment_Fault_Except flag will not make the operating system raise an alignment fault error even if the flag is not set.  The default state for ErrorMode is to set all flags to 0.  Defined values for this flag are are:
Fail_Critical_Errors - If this flag is set, the operating system does not display the critical-error-handler message box when such an error occurs. Instead, the operating system sends the error to the calling process.
No_Alignment_Fault_Except - (RISC only) If this flag is set, the operating system automatically fixes memory alignment faults and makes them invisible to the application. It does this for the calling process and any descendant processes.  This flag has no effect on x86 processors.
No_GP_Fault_Error_Box - If this flag is set, the operating system does not display the general-protection-fault message box when such an error occurs. This flag should only be set by debugging applications that handle general protection (GP) faults themselves via an appropriate exception handler.
No_Open_File_Error_Box - If this flag is set, the operating system does not display a message box when it fails to find a file.  Instead, the error is returned to the calling process.  Note, this flag is currently ignored.""" ;

This property is similar to a key value in that it can be used for identification, when correlating Indications (see the CorrelatedIndications array). Its value SHOULD be unique as long as correlations are reported, but MAY be reused or left NULL if no future Indications will reference it in their CorrelatedIndications array.To ensure uniqueness, the value of IndicationIdentifier should be constructed using the following "preferred" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the IndicationIdentifier or that is a recognized ID that is assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in IndicationIdentifier must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be re-used to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. 
If the above "preferred" algorithm is not used, the defining entity should assure that the resulting IndicationIdentifier is not re-used across any IndicationIdentifiers that are produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
For DMTF-defined instances, the "preferred" algorithm should be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM.""" ;

Various subclasses of this class may override this property to make it required, or a key. Such subclasses may also modify the preferred algorithms for ensuring uniqueness that are defined below.
To ensure uniqueness within the NameSpace, the value of InstanceID should be constructed using the following "preferred" algorithm: 
<OrgID>:<LocalID> 
Where <OrgID> and <LocalID> are separated by a colon (:), and where <OrgID> must include a copyrighted, trademarked, or otherwise unique name that is owned by the business entity that is creating or defining the InstanceID or that is a registered ID assigned to the business entity by a recognized global authority. (This requirement is similar to the <Schema Name>_<Class Name> structure of Schema class names.) In addition, to ensure uniqueness, <OrgID> must not contain a colon (:). When using this algorithm, the first colon to appear in InstanceID must appear between <OrgID> and <LocalID>. 
<LocalID> is chosen by the business entity and should not be reused to identify different underlying (real-world) elements. If not null and the above "preferred" algorithm is not used, the defining entity must assure that the resulting InstanceID is not reused across any InstanceIDs produced by this or other providers for the NameSpace of this instance. 
If not set to null for DMTF-defined instances, the "preferred" algorithm must be used with the <OrgID> set to CIM.""" ;

Limit Working Set - Causes all processes associated with the job to use the same minimum and maximum working set sizes.
Limit Process Time - Establishes a user-mode execution time limit for each currently active process and for all future processes associated with the job.
Limit Job Time - Establishes a user-mode execution time limit for the job. This flag cannot be used with Limit Preserve Job Time. 
Active Process Limit - Establishes a maximum number of simultaneously active processes associated with the job.
Limit Affinity - Causes all processes associated with the job to use the same processor affinity.
Limit Priority Class - Causes all processes associated with the job to use the same priority class. 
Limit Preserve Job Time - Preserves any job time limits you previously set. As long as this flag is set, you can establish a per-job time limit once, then alter other limits in subsequent calls. This flag cannot be used with Limit Job Time. 
Limit Scheduling Class - Causes all processes in the job to use the same scheduling class. 
Limit Process Memory - Causes all processes associated with the job to limit their committed memory. When a process attempts to commit memory that would exceed the per-process limit, it fails. If the job object is associated with a completion port, a JOB_OBJECT_MSG_PROCESS_MEMORY_LIMIT message is sent to the completion port. 
Limit Job Memory - Causes all processes associated with the job to limit the job-wide sum of their committed memory. When a process attempts to commit memory that would exceed the job-wide limit, it fails. If the job object is associated with a completion port, a JOB_OBJECT_MSG_JOB_MEMORY_LIMIT message is sent to the completion port. 
Limit Die On Unhandled Exception - Forces a call to the SetErrorMode function with the SEM_NOGPFAULTERRORBOX flag for each process associated with the job.
Limit Breakaway OK - If any process associated with the job creates a child process using the CREATE_BREAKAWAY_FROM_JOB flag while this limit is in effect, the child process is not associated with the job.
Silent Breakaway OK - Allows any process associated with the job to create child processes that are not associated with the job. """ ;

System - Interactive - This logon type is intended for users who will be interactively using the machine, such as a user being logged on by a terminal server, remote shell, or similar process. 
Network - This logon type is intended for high performance servers to authenticate clear text passwords. LogonUser does not cache credentials for this logon type. 
Batch - This logon type is intended for batch servers, where processes may be executing on behalf of a user without their direct intervention; or for higher performance servers that process many clear-text authentication attempts at a time, such as mail or web servers. LogonUser does not cache credentials for this logon type.
Service - Indicates a service-type logon. The account provided must have the service privilege enabled.
Proxy - Proxy logon. This logon type is not supported.
Unlock - This logon type is intended for GINA DLLs logging on users who will be interactively using the machine. This logon type allows a unique audit record to be generated that shows when the workstation was unlocked. 
Network Cleartext - Windows 2000: This logon type preserves the name and password in the authentication packages, allowing the server to make connections to other network servers while impersonating the client. This allows a server to accept clear text credentials from a client, call LogonUser, verify that the user can access the system across the network, and still communicate with other servers. 
New Credentials - Windows 2000: This logon type allows the caller to clone its current token and specify new credentials for outbound connections. The new logon session has the same local identify, but uses different credentials for other network connections.

The likelihood of two different   files producing the same MD5 checksum is very small  (about 1 in 2^64), and as such, the MD5 checksum of a file can be  used to construct a reliable content identifier that is very  likely to uniquely identify the file. The reverse is also true.  If two files have the same MD5 checksum, it is very likely that  the files are identical. For purposes of MOF specification  of the MD5 property, the MD5 algorithm always generates a 32  character string. For example: The string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz  generates the string c3fcd3d76192e4007dfb496cca67e13b.

    rdfs:comment """The CIM_ComputerSystem object and its derivatives are Top Level Objects of CIM. They provide the scope for numerous components. Having unique CIM_System keys is required. A heuristic is defined to create the CIM_ComputerSystem name to attempt to always generate the same name, independent of discovery protocol. This prevents inventory and management problems where the same asset or entity is discovered multiple times, but can not be resolved to a single object. Use of the heuristic is optional, but recommended. 

 The NameFormat property identifies how the computer system name is generated, using a heuristic. The heuristic is outlined, in detail, in the CIM V2 Common Model specification. It assumes that the documented rules are traversed in order, to determine and assign a name. The NameFormat values list defines the precedence order for assigning the computer system name. Several rules do map to the same Value. 

 Note that the CIM_ComputerSystem Name calculated using the heuristic is the system's key value. Other names can be assigned and used for the CIM_ComputerSystem that better suit the business, using Aliases.""" ;

It should be no larger than the ForwardBufferMemory value divided by 256, since at least 256 bytes of forward buffer memory are used for each packet. The optimal number of forward packets for a given ForwardBufferMemory size depends on the type of traffic carried on the network. It will lie somewhere between these two values. If the router is not enabled, this parameter is ignored and no headers are allocated. Default: 50, Valid Range: 1 - 0xFFFFFFFE." ;

TCP depends on receiving these messages to perform Path MTU Discovery. With this feature enabled, TCP will try to send segments without the Don't Fragment bit set if several retransmissions of a segment go unacknowledged. If the segment is acknowledged as a result, the MSS will be decreased and the Don't Fragment bit will be set in future packets on the connection. Enabling black hole detection increases the maximum number of retransmissions performed for a given segment. The default value of this property is FALSE." ;

    rdfs:comment "% Priority Time is the percentage of elapsed time that the processor spends executing threads that are not low priority. It is calculated by measuring the percentage of time that the processor spends executing low priority threads or the idle thread and then subtracting that value from 100%. (Each processor has an idle thread to which time is accumulated when no other threads are ready to run). This counter displays the average percentage of busy time observed during the sample interval excluding low priority background work. It should be noted that the accounting calculation of whether the processor is idle is performed at an internal sampling interval of the system clock tick. % Priority Time can therefore underestimate the processor utilization as the processor may be spending a lot of time servicing threads between the system clock sampling interval. Workload based timer applications are one example  of applications  which are more likely to be measured inaccurately as timers are signaled just after the sample is taken." ;

If the PriorityClass property is left null, the priority class defaults to Normal unless the priority class of the creating process is Idle or Below_Normal. In these cases, the child process receives the default priority class of the calling process. One of the following values can be specified:
High - Indicates a process that performs time-critical tasks that must be executed immediately for it to run correctly. The threads of a high-priority class process preempt the threads of normal-priority or idle-priority class processes. An example is Windows Task List, which must respond quickly when called by the user, regardless of the load on the operating system. Use extreme care when using the high-priority class, because a high-priority class CPU-bound application can use nearly all available cycles.  Only Realtime priority will preempt threads set to this level
Idle - Indicates a process whose threads run only when the system is idle and are preempted by the threads of any process running in a higher priority class. An example is a screen saver. The idle priority class is inherited by child processes.
Normal - Indicates a normal process with no special scheduling needs.
Realtime - Indicates a process that has the highest possible priority. The threads of a real-time priority class process preempt the threads of all other processes, including operating system processes performing important tasks, and high priority threads. For example, a real-time process that executes for more than a very brief interval can cause disk caches not to flush or cause the mouse to be unresponsive.
Above_Normal - (Windows 2000 and later) Indicates a process that has priority higher than Normal but lower than High.
Below_Normal - (Windows 2000 and later): Indicates a process that has priority higher than Idle but lower than Normal.""" ;

Each account has a unique SID issued by an authority (such as a Windows domain), stored in a security database. When a user logs on, the system retrieves the user's SID from the database and places it in the user's access token. The system uses the SID in the user's access token to identify the user in all subsequent interactions with Windows security. When a SID has been used as the unique identifier for a user or group, it cannot be used again to identify another user or group." ;

The sequence identifier for the indication enables a CIM listener to identify duplicate indications when the CIM service attempts the delivery retry of indications, to reorder indications that arrive out-of-order, and to detect lost indications.
If a CIM service does not support sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be NULL.
If a CIM service supports sequence identifiers for indications, this property shall be maintained by the CIM service for each registered listener destination, and its value shall uniquely identify the CIM service and the indication service within the CIM service such that restarts of the CIM service and deregistration of listener destinations to the CIM service cause the value to change, without reusing earlier values for a sufficiently long time.
When retrying the delivery of an indication, this property shall have the same value as in the original delivery.
To guarantee this uniqueness, the property value should be constructed using the following format (defined in ABNF): sequence-context = indication-service-name "#" cim-service-start-id "#" listener-destination-creation-time
Where: indication-service-name is the value of the Name property of the CIM_IndicationService instance responsible for delivering the indication. cim-service-start-id is an identifier that uniquely identifies the CIM service start, for example via a timestamp of the start time, or via a counter that increases for each start or restart. listener-destination-creation-time is a timestamp of the creation time of the CIM_ListenerDestination instance representing the listener destination.
Since this format is only a recommendation, CIM clients shall treat the value as an opaque identifier for the sequence context and shall not rely on this format.""" ;

Free - components place no restrictions on which threads or how many threads can enter the object. The object cannot contain thread-specific data and must protect its data from simultaneous access by multiple threads. Free-threaded components however, cannot be accessed by apartment threads directly, and calls to them are marshaled across from the client apartment.
Both - components that can be used in either apartment-threaded or free-threaded modes. These components can be entered by multiple threads, protect their data from thread collisions, and do not contain thread-specific data.
If this property is NULL, then no threading model is used. The component is created on the main thread of the client and calls from other threads are marshaled to this thread. Please refer to the Platform Software Development Kit for information on the various threading models.""" ;

A window station is a secure object that contains a clipboard, a set of global atoms and a group of desktop objects. The interactive window station assigned to the logon session of the interactive user also contains the keyboard, mouse, and display device. A desktop is a secure object contained within a window station.  A desktop has a logical display surface and contains windows, menus, and hooks.  A window station can have multiple desktops.

These threads are not created by the CLR; they are created outside the CLR but have since run inside the CLR at least once. Only unique threads are tracked; threads with same thread ID re-entering the CLR or recreated after thread exit are not counted twice. This counter is not an average over time; it displays the difference between the values observed in the last two samples divided by the duration of the sample interval." ;
