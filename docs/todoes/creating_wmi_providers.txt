How to create WMI provider.

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wmisdk/developing-a-wmi-provider

"A provider consists of classes defined in the Managed Object Format (MOF) schema
and a DLL file which carries out the functions of the provider."

Consider using Cython to create this DLL (pyd),
possibly compiling pywbem Python providers: https://pywbem.github.io/pyprov/index.html
