Transform method calls into RDF triples.

The subject is the instance class, the class is the class of course, the predicate is the method,
the parameters make literals or objects.
The call itself is reified, so metatada such as a timestamp can be added.
Possibly use the object address to build a IRI ?
This can logically work only if subset of the instance properties are immutable.
It depends on the class semantics, if an instance is uniquely defined by its properties.
