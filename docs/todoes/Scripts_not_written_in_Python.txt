A quick note about scripts written in another language than Python.

A possible architecture is to to create executables, which are also Python module:
That is, they export a function called "PyInit_something"
for Python 3 and "initsomething" for Python2.
Is it possible to use the same DLL for Python 2 and Python 3 ? This would simplify Survol installation.
This file is used as a main program (A CGI script) and as a compiled Python extension, imported by Python.
To behave like a normal Survol script, it must be able to generate RDF, DOT etc... using lib_common.
The advantages of this solution is that:
- It is transparent for the rest of Survol.
- It uses the rets of Survol framework defined in lib_common to generate its output in various formats.
The drawbacks are:
- It must call Python, hence possibly slow.
- It can only be written in C or C++, pratically.

On the other hand, it is tempting to be able to use any stand-alone program as long as it can write data to stdout,
so it would not need to call Python lib_common.
When called as a script, it just needs to adapt its output to mode=rdf, json, html, svg.
When Survol analyses available scripts, Survol must check if a script is executable, and wraps it into something.

It should be able to call the generation of RDF or

CGI programs whose name starts with "events_feeder_" fit in the category of not using Python features.
Other technical details:
- The ontology of classes could be written in json files instead of the Python file __init__.py associated to the class.
- The function Usable which tells if a class or a script is usable could be implemented differently ?
A script could possibly use embedded Python in some extreme cases.
