Change of architecture:
At the moment, Survol architecture allows to start processes which insert data into a RDF database.
The management of processes is OK because it matches the stcture of objects: Classes + key=value pairs.

What is less satisfying is that we use RDFLIB library to insert RDF triples.
We know that there are problems around SQLAlchemy. Also, not all semantic database have a plugin for RDFLIB.

It would be more general and flexible that running processes use SPARQL to insert RDF triples in a semantic database.
Survol would just need a SPARQL endpoint to insert and fetch RDF triples.

Javascript is also able to fetch data from a SPARQL endpoint.

This would completely decouple Survol code based on Python and RDFLIB from RDF triples storage.
