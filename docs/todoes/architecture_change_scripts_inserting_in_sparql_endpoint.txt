Survol usess RDFLIB library to insert RDF triples and depends for example on SQLAlchemy.
Also, not all semantic database have a plugin for RDFLIB.

It would be more general and flexible that running processes use SPARQL to insert RDF triples in a semantic database.
Survol would just need a SPARQL endpoint to insert and fetch RDF triples.

Javascript is also able to fetch data from a SPARQL endpoint.

This would completely decouple Survol code based on Python and RDFLIB from RDF triples storage.

This does not show what is the clearest and most standard way to store a RDF document.

"SPARQL INSERT" is a standard.

For reading data, use only Sparql, even if it is slow.
Again, it allows to use any semantic database with a Sparql end-point.

Insert in a named graph:
PREFIX dc: <http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/>
PREFIX ns: <http://example.org/ns#>
INSERT DATA
{ GRAPH <http://example/bookStore> { <http://example/book1>  ns:price  42 } }

Example with Virtuoso:
http://vos.openlinksw.com/owiki/wiki/VOS/VirtTipsAndTricksSPARQL11Insert#INSERT%20DATA%20Examples

INSERT DATA
  {
    GRAPH <urn:sparql:tests:insert:data>
      {
        <#book1> <#price> 42
      }
  }

  Now, to select from this named graph:
  SELECT *
FROM <urn:sparql:tests:insert:data>
WHERE
  {
    ?s ?p ?o
  }
