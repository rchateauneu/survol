The d3sparql.js library provides functions executing a SPARQL query by Ajax call (XMLHttpRequest)
and visualizing results by the D3 library.
Basically, this library transforms the SPARQL Query Results JSON Format (aka. application/sparql-results+json)
into several JSON formats which major D3 layouts can accept.
