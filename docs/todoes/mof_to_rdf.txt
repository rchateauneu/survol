MOF to RDF Mapping

"This specification provides a lightweight approach to transform MOF-compliant metamodels into OWL Ontologies.
The transformation is in principle bi-directional, however limitations imposed by MOF and/or OWL may apply.
The primary transformation direction supported by this specification is from MOF to OWL
and is made lossless through AnnotationProperties defined in the included MOF Support ontology."

Change the repository:
* The repository is defined with MOF files: Standard ones plus Survol ones.
* A pass generates RDF definitions. Ontology is in RDF, and accessed as such by scripts and Survol code.
* Possibly, this pass generates Python classes ? Prefer not to, so it does not rely on Python.
* Scripts are associated to MOF classes. In fact, URLS: Their implementations, scripts or anything, is hidden.

URL:
xx.yy.zz/CIM_Class/?prop1=val1&prop2=val2
xx.yy.zz/CIM_Class/a_script.py?prop1=val1&prop2=val2
xx.yy.zz/CIM_Class/another_script.something?prop1=val1&prop2=val2

This might help mixing different sorts of scripts: CGI or WSGI.

===================================================
Stackoverflow:
I wish to convert MOF (Managed Object Format),
a DMTF specification used to describe Common Information Model (CIM) classes,
into RDF (Resource Description Framework),
so data loaded from a WBEM server could be queried by semantic web tools such as SPARQL.

This MOF2RDF specification provides an approach to convert MOF-compliant metamodels
into OWL Ontologies and vice-versa.

https://www.omg.org/spec/MOF2RDF/1.0/About-MOF2RDF/

Although very assertive, it is quite abstract and does not states
if it applies to MOF files compiled by Microsoft WMI (mofcomp.exe)
and WBEM (cimmof, pywbem etc...), and does not say anythong about MOF input format
(text file ? XML Metadata Interchange ?)

As I am not used to this type of specification, I would like to know if I correctly understood this document:
- Is it only a specification without for example a draft implementation ?
- Where could I find concrete examples of input MOF files, in order to create an implementation
following these specs ?

Any interest into conversion to/from MOF ?

Pywbem:

2015 (It is a thesis)
"A semantic wiki-based platform for IT service management"
https://core.ac.uk/download/197537496.pdf
Mentions WBEM many times.
It mentions that MOF/CIM provides the best semantic expressiveness among network management models.
compared with SNMP, CMIP and DMI.

This is an extension to Mediawiki => It would allow to handle CIM data in mediawiki.
