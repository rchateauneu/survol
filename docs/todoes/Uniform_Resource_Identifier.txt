The Semantic Web uses the HTTP URI scheme to identify both documents and concepts in the real world,
a distinction which has caused confusion as to how to distinguish the two.
The TAG published an e-mail in 2005 on how to solve the problem, which became known as the httpRange-14 resolution.
The W3C subsequently published an Interest Group Note titled Cool URIs for the Semantic Web,
which explained the use of content negotiation and the HTTP 303 response code for redirections in more detail.

Consider using YAWN uris.
Also, extend it to WMI.
