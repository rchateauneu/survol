"CMDB schematic structures, also known as database schemas, take on multiple forms.
Two of the most common forms are those of a relational data model and a semantic data model.
...
Semantic data models typically rely on the resource description framework (RDF)
that maps the relation between a number of things through the use of relationship descriptors,
giving context to how things are related to each other."
