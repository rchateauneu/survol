Enhance rdf2dot with graphic information encoded in RDF

At the moment, the tool rdf2dot transforms RDF files into Graphviz DOT format,
and it would be great to add RDF statements for graphic metadata:

* Color and size of edges. Dashed/solid/dotted style edges.
* Color and shapes of nodes.
* Edge arrows can be unidirectional or bidirectional (although it could be deduced if we have s-p-o and o-p-s)
* DOT can group tabular data in HTML-like tables.
