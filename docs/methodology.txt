I finally got to review the doc that you shared.
Overall looks good - explains the approach of building a knowledge graph
to support system refactoring and explains static vs. dynamic aspects.

A couple of points:
1. If you mention BIAN, it is worth adding TOGAF into the same section on business terms.
TOGAF metamodel is convertible into OWL and is a good basis for describing enterprise architecture.
I just created a repo with TOGAF Metamodel Ontology based on earlier work of Aurona Gerber
https://github.com/cadmiumkitty/togaf-content-metamodel-ontology
2. I would not class StarDog as an ontology editing tool,
would suggest replacing it with TopQuadrant TopBraid Composer
https://www.topquadrant.com/products/topbraid-composer/
3. Would consider federation of data along with "merging" to a single repository
