              <p class="infotxt">Survol needs to run one agent per machine: a
                plain HTTP server runs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface"

                  class="a-link">Common Gateway Interface</a> (CGI) Python
                scripts. This agent and its port number define the identity of
                each object of this machine, that Survol is able to provide
                information about. This is the same concept as with WMI and
                WBEM, both inter-operate completely. Therefore, Survol is able
                to get information with another machine with no Survol agent:
                see OpenLMI, WMI etc... </p>
              <p class="infotxt">If your browser runs ActiveX, it is also
                possible to use Survol web pages with no agent.</p>

          <div class="col-md-12 col-xs-12">
            <p class="infotxt">Survol is based on a tree of Python scripts, all
              of them display information of the system the agent is running on.
              Some scripts do not need parameters: they will return information
              with no context: for example, all available databases, all
              detected machines on the network, all installed Python modules
              etc... Other scripts need parameters, as they display information
              about a specific object. For example: files opened by a specific
              process, columns of a SQL Server™ table, processes connected to an
              Oracle™ database.</p>
            <p class="infotxt">As a benefit of a CGI-based architecture, it is
              also possible to run any Python scripts as command-line programs.
              This allows to test them in isolation with full control on their
              environment and input, and full visibility on the output. This
              greatly helps when creating and testing scripts.</p>

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web-Based_Enterprise_Management"

                class="a-link">Web-Based Enterprise Management</a>, an industry
              initiative to develop a standard technology for accessing
              management information in an enterprise environment. This standard
              is governed by DMTF, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_Management_Task_Force"

                class="a-link">Distributed Management Task Force</a>. WMI is the
              Microsoft implementation of WBEM. In the Linux world, a common
              implementation of WBEM is <a href="http://www.openlmi.org/" class="a-link">OpenLMI</a>.
              It is based on an open-source implementation named <a href="https://collaboration.opengroup.org/pegasus/"

                class="a-link">OpenPegasus</a>™. WBEM standard information is
              delivered with CIM (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Information_Model_%28computing%29"

                class="a-link">Common Information Model</a>). The CIM schema is
              the model for delivering this standard information. </p>

            <h2 class="sec-head2 text-left clearfix">SURVOL DATA MODEL</h2>
            <p class="infotxt">One of the core aspects of Survol is its data
              model which attempts to take the best of the worlds it is working
              in. A first approach is WBEM. However, the data description
              offered by WBEM suffers from several drawbacks:</p>
            <ul class="datalist">
              <li>It does not define all the objects we need, because CIM is
                very neutral, not oriented to applications management. For
                example, database tables, or sockets, or Python packages or
                Samba™ servers have no definition. It is indeed possible to add
                new classes into WIM or WMI, but not in a portable way, and it
                requires C++ code compilation etc... this is quite a heavy
                process.</li>
              <li>Also: WQL, the CIM query language, has some limitations: It
                does not allow joins between several classes, and a query can
                return objects of a single class only. Whereas some information
                snapshot would require of all sorts of objects to completely
                describe a situation: Some examples which cannot be described by
                WQL queries could be: All network files accessed by a process,
                plus their sockets. Or linkable symbols from a DLL file. Or SQL
                queries detected in a process memory, plus their tables. These
                are quite common situations when investigating an application.
                However, it can be represented with WBEM.</li>
              <li>On top of that, WMI and WBEM suffer from several specific
                performance problems which are difficult to overcome. These
                problems come from the indistinct processing of objects,
                whatever their behaviour. For example, selecting all
                CMI_Datafile objects will return all files on a given machine:
                This is obviously very difficult to handle.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="sec-subhead">Despite this, building a software on an
              industrial standard is invaluably convenient. Therefore, Survol
              attempts to combine the best of both worlds:</p>
            <ul class="datalist">
              <li>Existing WBEM classes are always reused. When the classes are
                different in Linux and Windows, but a common base class exist,
                this base class is chosen. Survol uses only a subset of WBEM
                ontologies: That is, it uses only the minimal number of WBEM
                class properties which are necessary to uniquely define an
                object. However, all detected properties are displayed, when
                available.</li>
              <li>Survol comes with a lightweight ontology and data definition
                where a class is only defined by a directory in a Python source
                code tree.</li>
              <li>When an object is defined by Survol, its equivalent link into
                WBEM or WMI is calculated and accessible. WBEM, WMI and Survol
                use the same moniker strings (Object path).</li>
              <li>It is possible to display any WMI or WBEM object and navigate
                into their repository. Survol is -also- a complete read-only
                WBEM objects browser. Notably, Survol can "talk" with WBEM or
                WMI running on distant machines.</li>

            <h2 class="sec-head2 text-left clearfix">SCRIPTS REDUNDANCY</h2>
            <p class="infotxt">Survol is designed to run in a harsh environment,
              uncertain platforms, broken libraries, incompatible interfaces,
              and return as much information as possible about unknown
              applications. It has to be robust and adapt to any situation.
              Therefore, it is built, at all stages, on the concept of
              redundancy. </p>
            <p class="sec-subhead">Redundancy of data display:</p>
            <p class="sec-subhead2">Survol can display its results in:</p>
            <ul class="datalist">
              <li>Plain HTML text: Results of the same scripts are guaranteed to
                be return in the same order, allowing automatic comparison. It
                can be displayed on a very simple browser.</li>
              <li>Static SVG generated by Graphviz, on the server side. It does
                not need a powerful client machine.</li>
              <li>Client-side D3 display: It is not demanding on the server
                side, but needs a more powerful client.</li>
              <li>RDF output, for Semantic Web engine.</li>
              <li>JSON output: this is used by D3, its API is stable and can be
                used by client software too.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="sec-subhead">Redundancy of information sources:</p>
            <p class="infotxt">The core information might come from any source:
              win32 Python library, any Linux package, WMI and WBEM select
              statements.</p>
            <p class="sec-subhead">Redundancy of Web hosting:</p>
            <p class="infotxt">Scripts can be hosted by Apache, IIS™, the
              dedicated ad hoc CGI server. Any reasonable HTTP server with CGI
              or WSGI capabilities should suffice.</p>
            <p class="sec-subhead">Redundancy of Python interpreter and
              libraries:</p>
            <ul class="datalist">
              <li>It can use Python2 and Python3, over many releases. Survol is
                not very demanding in terms of Python features.</li>
              <li>Packages: Python requires a very small set of modules. If a
                script needs an optional Python module which is not installed,
                the script is simply disabled, doing no harm.</li>
              <li>Scripts might return information with a significant overlap,
                from different libraries or mechanisms. This is helpful if one
                script does not work, as a work-around might exist. And, because
                objects in Survol, always have the same URL, this does not yield
                duplicate, when combining, merging the results of several
                scripts into one: duplicate information is automatically removed
                when at this stage. Even objects created by ActiveX™ are
                smoothly paired with the ones created by Python agents. This is
                the reason why objects URLs do not accept any CGI parameter
                except the display mode.</li>

            <p class="infotxt">Survol scripts access many software resources,
              some of them being protected with credentials, typically a
              username and a password. These credentials are made available to
              Survol with a JSON file, SurvolCredentials.json, residing in the
              users' home directory. Depending on the user running the HTTP
              server (Apache, IIS etc...), this home directory may vary. This
              file can be edited with the "Credentials" page link.</p>
            <p class="infotxt">It contains several types of credentials,
              depending on the type of access: Database software, middleware
              library etc... For each of this access type, it is possible to
              add, delete, update any credentials. On the other hand, it is not
              possible, without extra development, to add new types of
              credentials as these need specific software to use them.</p>
